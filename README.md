# ThrowableFireballs
A plugin that makes fireballs throwable, originally published on SpigotMC - like on hypixel, jartexnetwork etc. Working from 1.13 to 1.21.

**A little showcase of the plugin:** https://youtu.be/MQTXVUTDw8s

This is a Spigot plugin and is not guaranteed to work with paper; I do, however run my test environment with papermc and so there should be no issues.

##  Installation
If you're having  trouble starting a server or don't know where to start, I suggest the following article from PaperMC 
### https://docs.papermc.io/paper/getting-started<br>
You can also use spigot build tools:
https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/



If  your server is properly configured, simply drop the release jar file into your /plugins directory in your server's root folder.
After rebooting or reloading the server, the plugin is accessible via the /throwablefireballs command and its various aliases.

(see: https://github.com/FlailoftheLord/ThrowableFireballs/blob/master/src/plugin.yml#L12-L18)  for refference.
